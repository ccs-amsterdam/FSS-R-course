Data Analysis with R - VU-FSS Course
================

Welcome to the course “Data Analysis with R” that will be held twice a
year at the Faculty of Social Sciences at the Vrije Universiteit
Amsterdam. In order to facilitate the switch to R in our faculty, we
organize four monthly, informal sessions in which the basics of using R
for statistical analyses will be introduced, discussed and practiced.
The course is consecutive, that is each session builds on the previous
one.

The course is organized collaboratively by various colleagues from the
faculty of social sciences. Everybody is welcome to join at any time.
Below, you’ll find an overview of the planned sessions in the summer
semester 2022. *Dates, time, and place will be announced shortly.*

## Overview

Before the first session, we ask you to make sure that R and RStudio is
installed on your computer and that you have played around with R at
least a little bit. For this purpose, we invite you to work through the
first tutorial called “[Getting
Started](https://github.com/ccs-amsterdam/r-course-material/blob/master/tutorials/R_basics_1_getting_started_short.md)”.
But don’t worry if something doesn’t work. The basics of using R will
again be covered in the first session.

## Further resources

Learning R of course doesn’t end after these four sessions. We hope that
afterwards, you will want to dive deeper into the many different things
that one can do with R. For this purpose, we created various tutorials
that can help you learn more advanced methods (e.g., multilevel
modeling, structural equation modeling, machine learning, text analysis,
etc.). You can find the handouts (similar to the ones we use in this
course) and corresponding video tutorials on this repistory:

## Literature

We strongly recommend to also work with other tutorials and handbooks,
which cover different aspects of using R. Below is a short list of books
that we found useful:

-   Field, A., Miles, K., & Field, Z. (2012). Discovering statistics
    using R. Sage.

-   van Atteveldt, W., Trilling, D. & Calderon, C. A. (2022).
